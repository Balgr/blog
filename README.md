This project has been realized in the context of OpenClassrooms' "PHP/Symfony Developer path". It is actually the 5th project I have to set up for this path.
The aim is to build it from scratch : this means no use of any framework, CMS or whatever. We are however allowed to integrate external libraries through Composer.

I chose to integrate 3 of those external libraries :
 - Twig : this templating system facilitates the output of HTML pages A LOT. 
 - Datatables : provides several useful features for tables used in the backend (ordering, pagination...)
 - Symfony YAML : I chose to store configuration files in Yaml format, so this is very useful
 - Upload : simple PHP library that handles file uploading
